# Skin-Lesions-Classifier-ResNet50
A skin lesions classifier created using ResNet50 in keras, trained on HAM10000. Solved data imbalance by oversampling + data augmentation

Here's an intuitive explanation I wrote for how ResNet works & why it's used: https://medium.com/@realmichaelye/intuition-for-resnet-deep-residual-learning-for-image-recognition-39d24d173e78
